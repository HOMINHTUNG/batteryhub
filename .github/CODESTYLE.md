# Code Style Guidelines for BatteryHub

Our code style guidelines is based on the [Android Code Style Guidelines for Contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).

You can run a checkstyle with most rules via a gradle command:

```shell
$ ./gradlew checkstyle
```

It generates a HTML report in `app/build/reports/checkstyle/checkstyle.html`.
