## Build Instructions

### Gradle

#### Linux and Mac OS:

Make sure `gradlew` is executable, by typing this command:
```shell
$ chmod +x gradlew
```

You can now build and test the project:
```shell
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
$ ./gradlew check
```

#### Windows:

```shell
$ gradlew.bat assembleDebug
$ gradlew.bat check
```


### Docker

If it is the first time building the Android app with Docker, it is necessary to build a local Docker image before running it. Afterwards just run a container:
```shell
$ docker build -t greenhub-project/batteryhub .  # Only necessary for first build
$ docker run -it --name container-name \         # Choose a container name
-v `pwd`:/usr/src/app \                          # DO NOT change this src path
hmatalonga/greenhub-android \
/bin/sh -c \
"./gradlew assembleDebug; ./gradlew check"
```

To execute another gradle task, simply create a new container:
```shell
$ docker run -it --name container-name \        # Choose another container name
-v `pwd`:/usr/src/app \                         # DO NOT change this src path
greenhub-project/batteryhub \
/bin/sh -c \
"./gradlew task-name"
```

To start an existing container, type:
```shell
$ docker start -i container-name
```

One line build, for copy-paste:
```shell
docker build -t greenhub-project/batteryhub . && docker run -it --name greenhub-app -v `pwd`:/usr/src/app greenhub-project/batteryhub /bin/sh -c "./gradlew assembleDebug; ./gradlew check"
```

To list all available gradle tasks run `./gradlew tasks`.
